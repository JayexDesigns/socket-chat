<h1 align="center">Socket Chat</h1>
<p align="center">This is a websocket project that allows you to chat with anybody connected to the same websocket</p>
<br/>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The backend is done with NodeJS using Express for the web server and Socket IO for the websocket communication, for testing and temporary hosting I used a Raspberry Pi 4 model B 2gb of RAM. The frontend it's done with React, Material UI and Socket IO Client.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Backend</h2>
<p>To install all the dependencies simply use the command npm install if you have node and npm installed. Using the command node /src/index.js will start the server or if you prefer you can use nodemon to update the server whenever a file changes.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Frontend</h2>
<p>To install all the dependencies simply use the command yarn install if you have yarn installed, if not using npm should work too. Using the command npm run start will start a development server with a slow testing version of the frontend, using npm run build will create a build folder in which you can copy the content and replace the public folder content on the backend with it. asdasd</p>
